We are looking for one natural maple shaker style cabinet door. We will be converting and covering our wine rack area in the photos below with this door. The wide filler piece is there because this is an angled corner in the kitchen.  I don't need hinges, but I do need all the holes for them.

W: 8 1/2"
H: 35 1/4"

The surrounding trim width is 2 5/8".

Let me know if you need any additional information for a quote.

Thanks!
